    "summary": "My first contact with a programming language was at age 13 when I found out that I could automate things on IRC using mIRC Scripting. After that, I learned HTML and Perl + CGI to create my first website. Then I learned Javascript and CSS. I spent some time with PHP when it became popular in the early years of 2000. \nI also have a hobby interest in electronics since high school, where I learned to program micro-controllers. Because of this, I started the Electronic Engineering career at the university, but after some courses and different types of programable sensors and micro-controllers, I was sure that my true passion is programming, and that electronics is just a hobby. \nI got my first job as a .Net developer in 2007 and since then I developed a wide variety of skills, from front-end frameworks to a deep understanding of DNS to support Argentinian ccTLD, with lots of fancy words in the middle (Sharepoint, .Net, Silverlight, MVVM, TDD, BDD, SQL and NoSQL, Web Services, OAuth, CI, CD and much more). \nIn 2014 I focused my career on front-end development, learning frameworks like React and Vue while using all my previous knowledge to help my teams to create better front-end architectures, seamlessly integrated with the back-end services and automating everything, from build to production deployment, ensuring a seamless, less stressful and enjoyable development experience for the teams I'm working with.",
