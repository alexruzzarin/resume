    "about-me": "I am a knowledgeable and professional software engineer with almost 20 years of experience in the area. \nMy first contact with a programming language was at age 13 when I discovered that I could automate things on IRC using mIRC Scripting. I then learned HTML and Perl + CGI, which I used to create my first website. I followed this with Javascript and CSS, as well as PHP when it became popular in the early 2000s. \nI also developed an interest in electronics during high school when I learned to program micro-controllers. I started the Electronic Engineering major at the university, but after taking some courses, I realized electronics are more of a hobby of mine. My true passion is programming. \nI got my first job as a .Net developer in 2007 and since then have obtained a wide variety of experience and skills: from mastering front-end frameworks to developing a deep understanding of DNS to support Argentinian ccTLD, with a lot of fancy technical terms learned in between (Sharepoint, .Net, Silverlight, MVVM, TDD, BDD, SQL and NoSQL, Web Services, OAuth, CI, CD, etc.). \nIn 2014, I began to focus my career on front-end development. I studied frameworks like React and Vue and combined them with my previous knowledge to help my teams create better front-end architectures. Together we seamlessly integrated with the back-end services and automated everything, from build to production deployment, ensuring a less stressful and more effective development experience for the team. \nI helped making USA healthcare more accessible.",
