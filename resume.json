    "summary": "My first contact with a programming language was on my age 13 when I found out that I can automate things on IRC using mIRC Scripting. After that, I learned HTML and Perl + CGI to create my first website. Then I learned Javascript and CSS. I spend some time with PHP when it became popular in earlies 2000s.<br/>I also develop a hobby interest in electronics since high school, where I learned to program microcontrollers. When I joined the Electronic Engineering university, after getting in touch with different types of programable sensors and microcontrollers I was sure that my true passion is programming, not electronics.<br/>I got my first job as a .Net developer and since then I develop a nice variety of skills, from frontend frameworks to a deep understanding of DNS to support Argentinian cTLD, with lots of fancy words in the middle (Sharepoint, .Net, Silverlight, MVVM, TDD, BDD, SQL and noSQL, Web Services, OAuth, CI, CD and much more).<br/>6 years ago, I focused my career in the frontend, learning frameworks like React and Vue, using all my previous knowledge to help my teams to create better frontend architectures, well-integrated with the backend services and automating everything, from build to production deployment, ensuring a nice development experience to the teams I'm working with.",
